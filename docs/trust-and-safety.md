## 8. MVP focus baked into the repo

**Week-1 ready**
- `/chat` API
- Manual doc ingestion
- Slack bot
- Feedback endpoint

**No premature complexity**
- No per-user memory
- No auto-updates
- No predictive nudges yet

---

## 9. Why this repo structure works

- Clear separation between **knowledge**, **reasoning**, and **interfaces**
- Easy to add new roles, teams, or data sources
- Safe by default (team-level memory only)
- Scales from MVP → real product without rewrite

---

If you want, next I can:
- Initialize this repo with actual files (copy-paste ready)
- Design the **Slack bot flow**
- Define the **RAG schema + metadata model**
- Create the **confidence & escalation logic**
- Or turn this into a **pitch-ready system diagram**

Just tell me where you want to go next 🚀
